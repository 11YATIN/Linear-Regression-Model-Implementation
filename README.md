# Linear Regression Model Implementation

This Python code implements a simple linear regression model, a foundational machine learning technique for predicting continuous target variables based on independent input features. The project encompasses functions for model training, prediction, evaluation, and optimization using gradient descent.

## Functions Overview

### 1. Training the Model
The `train(x, y)` function computes the model's slope (m) and intercept (c) using the least squares method. It is essential for initializing the model.

### 2. Making Predictions
For predictions, the `predict(x, m, c)` function estimates target variable values based on the model coefficients (m and c).

### 3. Model Evaluation
The `score(y_test, y_predicted)` function calculates the coefficient of determination (R-squared), indicating how well the model fits the data and performs against test data.

### 4. Cost Calculation
The `cost(x, y, m, c)` function quantifies the mean squared error (MSE) to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.

### 5. Gradient Descent Optimization
Gradient descent optimization is pivotal for model refinement. The `gd(x, y, learning_rate, m, c)` function iteratively updates model parameters (m and c) to minimize the cost function.

### 6. Training the Model with Gradient Descent
The `gradient_descent(x_train, y_train, learning_rate, num)` function utilizes gradient descent to train the model, progressively enhancing parameters (m and c) over a specified number of iterations (num).

### 7. Generic Gradient Descent for Multiple Features
In scenarios with multiple input features, the `generic_gd(x_train, y_train, learning_rate, num)` function optimizes separate parameters for each feature.

### 8. Prediction with Multiple Features
The `predict_generic(x, m, c)` function extends prediction capabilities to accommodate multiple input features.

## Summary
This code offers a versatile toolkit for creating, fine-tuning, and evaluating linear regression models using gradient descent. It is applicable to various regression tasks where establishing linear relationships between input features and continuous target variables is the objective. Ensure that you have NumPy installed and provide relevant input data for successful model execution.
